KennyInTheCloset: So yeah, i've split up with Casey now
Motherbird: Uh huh.
KennyInTheCloset: She just never appreciated anything I did for her
Motherbird: That's nice
KennyInTheCloset: Being alone on valentines day sucks
Motherbird: I really don't care
KennyInTheCloset: Harsh.
Motherbird: Did you encrypt the recovery word?
KennyInTheCloset: Of course I made her pay back everything I spent on her today
Motherbird: The passphrase, Kenny.
KennyInTheCloser: including tax
Motherbird: Can you please stay on task?
KennyInTheCloset: Sorry, my mind has just been on this all day. Can't think of anything else
Motherbird: Think on your own time
KennyInTheCloset: But yeah, it's encrypted.
Motherbird: Good.
KennyInTheCloset: Honestly, might go play the new Payday game I bought
Motherbird: You do that.
KennyInTheCloset: Do you think she's moved on already?
Motherbird: If I answer, do I get to leave this conversation?
KennyInTheCloser: Eh, probably not. I mean, have you seen her style in shoes?
Motherbird: You know, there's probably a reason for your username...
