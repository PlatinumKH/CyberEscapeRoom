Hey, Motherbird.

So, uh, don't mean to anger you but...little problem!

I've stored my codeword and it's locked up tight in my cyber chest 
But...I've forgotten the code to my codeword and haven't been able to crack it.

Unfortunately, I have fried my systems and locked myself out so won't be able to open it for a bit.

However, I managed to do some analysis on given inputs:

6 8 2 - One number is correct and well placed

6 1 4 - One number is correct but wrong placed

2 0 6 - Two numbers are correct but wrong placed

7 3 8 - Nothing is correct

7 8 0 - One number is correct but wrong placed

Could you pass it on to one of the other hackers to crack for me?
Thanks, man!
