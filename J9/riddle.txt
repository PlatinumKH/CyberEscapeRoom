For this riddle, you have to find the odd ones out in the groups of words. 
BUT WAIT! There's a catch. Each group of words has TWO words which do not belong. 
Can you find them both?

EXAMPLE:

Lily - Jane - Tulip - Rose

Jane does not belong as it's the only one which is not a flower.

Tulip also does not belong because it's the only one which is not a girl's name.

You're on your own for the rest!

2. King - Earl - Knight - Bishop

3. Yellow - Green - Dead - Black
