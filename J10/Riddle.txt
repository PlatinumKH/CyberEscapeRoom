There are 5 pirates, they must decide how to distribute 100 gold coins among them. 
The pirates have seniority levels, the senior-most is A, then B, then C, then D, and finally the junior-most is E.

Rules of distribution are:

- The most senior pirate proposes a distribution of coins.
- All pirates vote on whether to accept the distribution.
- If the distribution is accepted, the coins are disbursed and the game ends.
- If not, the proposer is made to walk the plank and dies, and the next most senior pirate makes a new proposal to begin the system again.
- In case of a tie vote the proposer can has the casting vote

Every pirate wants to survive
Given survival, each pirate wants to maximize the number of gold coins he receives.

Assuming each pirate plays optimally, what is the maximum number of coins that pirate A can get?
