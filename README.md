# CyberEscapeRoom
A Cyber Escape Room I created for my friends, full of cryptic puzzles

Everyone gets into teams of pairs and have 3 hours to embark upon a cyber escape room full of multiple puzzles that require an answer or codeword to break

Each room grants a certain number of points. The team with the most amount of points at the end, wins the Escape Room!
