Hak here!
I need to break into an online account of two hackers who share it. 
However, there are some account recovery questions I need to answer.

I've secured some audio from the two which contain the answers to said questions.
Unfortunately, I can't get anything out of it.

See if you can get anything out of it.

Send me the answers to the following questions:

1. "Where did I go to get my candy from that one time?"
2. "What did the candy look like?"
3. "Why did I want to leave the candy around the house?"
